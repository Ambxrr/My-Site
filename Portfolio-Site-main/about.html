      <p>My name is Amber Russell, I'm a graphic designer from Providence, RI. Growing up, my love for creating began with fine arts, mostly painting and drawing. As I got older, I gravitated towards digital art and the commercial arts, but my love for hands on fine arts never left. I have experience using programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, After Effects, Canva, and more recently I've been learning Figma. In June 2021, I had my first exhibition at Mount Pleasant Library. In June 2022, I had some of my work displayed in RISD Project Open Door's end of the year exhibition. Most recently, I had my work displayed in RISD Project Open Door's 20th year exhibit over this past summer. To see some more of my work, check out my Instagram or TikTok @blurryvision.exe!</p>

      Amber Russell is a graphic designer and visual artist based in Providence, RI, specializing in horror, punk, and grunge-inspired aesthetics. Her work explores texture, atmosphere, and raw emotional impact through experimental processes and a wide range of materials. With a practice rooted in curiosity and hands-on exploration, she frequently incorporates skills in digital design, bookbinding, sewing, and mixed media to create immersive visual experiences. She is currently studying Graphic Design at Rhode Island College, where she has refined her technical abilities using tools such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, After Effects, and Figma. Throughout her academic journey, she has developed a strong focus on composition, visual storytelling, and unconventional aesthetics that challenge traditional design norms. Her work has been featured in several exhibitions, including the 2021 Mount Pleasant Library Exhibition, the 2022 Project Open Door End-of-Year Exhibit, and the 2025 Project Open Door 20-Year Exhibition and will soon be in the February 2026 Chazan Gallery Exhibit. Combining experimentation with a distinctive alternative style, Amber continues to develop work that is bold, atmospheric, and memorable.
